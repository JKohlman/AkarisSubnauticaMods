Engine Efficiency Module MK 2:
A module for the seamoth and prawn suit that boosts engine efficiency by double the original. You craft it with an original module and an extra advanced wiring kit at the same place as the original.
Huge thanks to Nagorrogan and DaWrecka for helping me, since this was my first mod.
This mod is NOT compatible with:
